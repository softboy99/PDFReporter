    1999 LYRICS - PRINCE
[Don't worry, I won't hurt you, 
I only want you to have some fun, 
I was dreamin' when I wrote this, 
Forgive me if it goes astray, 
, 
But when I woke up this mornin', 
Could've sworn it was Judgment Day, 
The sky was all purple, 
There were people runnin' everywhere, 
, 
Tryin' to run from the destruction, 
You know I didn't even care, 
'Cuz they say 2000 zero zero party over, oops, out of time!, 
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999, 
, 
I was dreamin' when I wrote this, 
So sue me if I go too fast, 
But life is just a party, 
And parties weren't meant to last, 
, 
War is all around us, my mind says, 'Prepare to fight', 
So if I gotta die, I'm gonna listen to my body tonight, 
Yeah, they say 2000 zero zero party over, oops, out of time!, 
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999!, 
(Yeah, yeah), 
, 
People, let me tell you somethin', 
If you didn't come to party, 
Don't bother knockin' on my door, 
I got a lion in my pocket and, baby, he's ready to roar, 
(Yeah), 
, 
Everybody's got a bomb, we could all die any day, 
(Oh), 
But before I let that happen, I'll dance my life away, 
Oh, they say 2000 zero zero party over, oops, out of time!, 
(We're runnin' out of time), 
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999!, 
(We gonna, we gonna, oh!), 
, 
Say it one more time, 
2000 zero zero party over, oops, out of time!, 
(No, no), 
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999!, 
(We're gonna, we gonna), 
Alright, 1999, you say it, 1999, 1999, 
(1999), 
, 
Don't stop, don't stop, say it one more time, 
2000 zero zero party over, oops, out of time!, 
(Yeah, yeah), 
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999!, 
(We gonna, we're gonna), 
Yeah, 1999, 
(1999), 
, 
Don't you wanna go?, 
(1999), 
Don't you wanna go?, 
(1999), 
We could all die any day, 
(1999), 
I don't wanna die, I'd rather dance my life away, 
(1999), 
, 
Listen to what I'm tryin' to say, 
Everybody, everybody say party, 
Come on now, you say it, 
(Party!), 
That's right, everybody say, 
(Party!) [unverified], 
, 
Can't run from revelation, no, 
Sing it for your nation, y'all, 
Dreamin' when you're singin', baby, 
Say the telephone a-ringin', mama, now, 
, 
Come on, come on, you say, 
Everybody, two times, 
Work it down to the ground, I'm sayin', 
(Oh baby, say it again), 
(Oh, shake your body, baby!), 
, 
That's right, come on, sing the song, 
That's right, everybody say, 
Got a lion in my pocket mama, say, 
Ah, and he's ready to roar, yeah, 
, 
Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?, 
Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?,

    LITTLE RED CORVETTE LYRICS - PRINCE
[I guess I shoulda known, 
By the way you parked your car sideways, 
That it wouldn't last, 
, 
See you're the kinda person, 
That believes in makin' out once, 
Love 'em and leave 'em fast,

And honey I say, 
, 
Little red Corvette, baby, you're much too fast, 
Little red Corvette, you need a love that's gonna last,

I guess I shoulda closed my eyes, 
When you drove me to the place, 
Where your horses run free, 
, 
'Cuz I felt a little ill, 
When I saw all the pictures, 
Of the jockeys that were there before me, 
, 
Believe it or not, 
I started to worry, 
I wondered if I had enough class, 
, 
But it was Saturday night, 
I guess that makes it all right, 
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?", 
Oh yeah, 
, 
Little red Corvette, baby, you're much too fast, yes, you are, 
Little red Corvette, you need to find a love that's gonna last, how long?, 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 
Ooh, ooh, ooh,

A body like yours oughta be in jail, 
'Cuz it's on the verge of bein' obscene, 
Move over baby, gimme the keys, 
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine, 
, 
Little red Corvette, baby, you're much too fast, 
Little red Corvette, you need to find a love that's gonna last, 
Little red Corvette, honey, you got to slow down, 
(Got to slow down), 
Little red Corvette, 'cuz if you don't you gonna run into [Incomprehensible],

Little red Corvette, right down to the ground, 
(Honey you got to slow down), 
You, you, got to slow down, 
Little red Corvette, you're movin' much too fast, 
Too fast, you need to find a love that's gonna last, 
, 
Girl, you got an ass like I never seen, 
And the ride, I say the ride is so smooth, 
You must be a limousine, 
Baby, you're much too fast, 
, 
Little red Corvette, you need a love, 
You need a love that's ah, that's gonna last, 
Little red Corvette, you got to slow down, 
(You got to slow down), 
, 
Little red Corvette, 'cuz if you don't, 'cuz if you don't, 
You gonna run your body right into the ground, 
Right into the ground, right into the ground, 
Right into the ground, little red Corvette,

This is for the ocean, the sea, the shore, 
This is for and that's for you and that's who that one's for, 
This is for the women, so beautifully complex, 
This one's for love without sex, 
, 
This is for the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow, 
Not knowing where I'm going, 
This galaxy's better than not having a place to go,

It's time for a new direction, 
It's time for jazz to die, 
4th day of November, 
We need a purple high, 
, 
Don't give up, I'll still love you, 
, 
All the critics love you in New York, 
All the critics love you in New York, 
All the critics love you, all the critics love you, 
All the critics love you in New York, 
, 
Body don't wanna quit, gotta get another hit, 
Body don't wanna quit, gotta get another hit, 
Body don't wanna quit, gotta get another hit, 
Body don't wanna quit, gotta get another hit, 
, 
Fuck me over, 
All the critics love you, all the critics love you, 
All the critics love you in New York,

Whaddayou lookin' at, punk?, 
Look out, all you hippies, you ain't as sharp as me, 
It ain't about the trippin', but the sexuality, turn it up,

You can dance if you want to,

INTERNATIONAL LOVER LYRICS - PRINCE
[May I have this dance?, 
, 
Darlin', it appears to me, 
That you could use a date tonight, 
A body that'll do you right, 
Tell me, am I qualified?, 
, 
I say, baby, I know it's hard to believe, 
But this body here is free tonight, 
Your very own first class flight, 
My plane's parked right outside, baby, 
Don't you wanna go for a ride?, 
, 
I'm an international lover, yeah, that's right, 
Let me take you 'round the world, 
I'll buy you diamonds and pearls, 
Only if you're good girl, 
, 
Darlin', I know it's been a long time, 
Since you've been satisfied, 
I can tell by the look in your eyes, 
You need it real bad, you need it so bad, so bad, 
, 
Baby, maybe if you're good, girl, 
I'll introduce you to my ride, 
Don't you wanna come inside?, 
Come on baby, I won't fly too fast, 
I've got so, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
, 
, 
International lover, that's right, baby, 
Let me take you 'round the world, yeah, yeah, 
I'll buy you diamonds and pearls, 
  (I will buy you diamonds and pearls, baby), 
Only if you're good girl, 
  (Gotta be good, you gotta be good, yeah, yeah, please), 
, 
Good evening, this is your pilot Prince speaking, 
You are flyin' aboard the Seduction 747, 
And this plane is fully equipped, 
With anything your body desires, 
, 
If for any reason there is a loss in cabin pressure, 
I will automatically drop down to apply more, 
To activate the flow of excitement, 
Extinguish all clothing materials and pull my body close to yours, 
Place my lips over your mouth and kiss, kiss, normally, 
In the event there is over excitement, 
Your seat cushion may be used as a flotation device, 
, 
We ask that you please observe the 'No letting go' sign, 
I anticipate a few turbulence along the way, 
, 
We are now makin' our final approach to satisfaction, 
Please bring your lips, your arms, your hips, 
Into the upright and locked position, 
For landing, can you feel it, can you feel it?, 
Yeah, 
, 
Welcome to Satisfaction, 
Please remain awake until the aircraft, 
Has come to a complete stop, 
Thank you for flying 'Prince International', 
Remember, the next time you fly, 
Fly the 'International Lover",
