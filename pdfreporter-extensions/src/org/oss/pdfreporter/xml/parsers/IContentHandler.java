     * character data.  SAX parsers may return all contiguous character
     * data in a single chunk, or they may split it into several
     * chunks; however, all of the characters in any single event
     * must come from the same external entity so that the Locator

     *
     * <p>Individual characters may consist of more than one Java
     * <code>char</code> value.  There are two important cases where this
     * happens, because characters can't be represented in just sixteen bits.
     * In one case, characters are represented in a <em>Surrogate Pair</em>,
     * using two special Unicode values. Such characters are in the so-called
     * "Astral Planes", with a code point above U+FFFF.  A second case involves
     * composite characters, such as a base character combining with one or
     * more accent characters. </p>
     *
     * <p> Your code should not assume that algorithms using
     * <code>char</code>-at-a-time idioms will be working in character
     * units; in some cases they will split characters.  This is relevant
     * wherever XML permits arbitrary characters, such as attribute values,
     * processing instruction data, and comments as well as in data reported
     * from this method.  It's also generally relevant whenever Java code
     * manipulates internationalized text; the issue isn't unique to XML.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that some parsers will report whitespace in element
     * content using the {@link #ignorableWhitespace ignorableWhitespace}
     * method rather than this one (validating parsers <em>must</em> 
     * do so).</p>
